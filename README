This is Msql::RDBMS, version 0.10. It will eventually be a complete
relational database management system for Msql. It uses HTML forms
as an interface.

REQUIRED COMPONENTS
===================

You will need:
CGI-modules-2.75.tar.gz
CounterFile-0.6.pm.gz
MsqlPerl-1.04.tar.gz

All of which can be found on CPAN. Start at http://www.perl.com to make your
way towards these modules. Here are the specific modules that are used:

CGI
CGI::Carp
Msql
File::CounterFile

INSTALLATION
============

In order to install this, you should enter the top-level directory
of the distribution, and issue the following commands:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

NOTES
=====

Documentation is contained within the module (RDBMS.pm) in pod format;
when you issue the installation commands, you should then be able to type:

man 3 Msql::RDBMS

or just:

man Msql::RDBMS

to get the whole story.

THE FUTURE
==========

Keep an eye on either:
